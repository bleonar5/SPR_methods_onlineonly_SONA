<h3><b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY:</b></h3>
The goal of the project is to measure what makes particular aspects of language easier or harder to learn and understand. 
<h3><b>PROCEDURE:</b></h3>
<p>You will be asked to read or listen to language, and answer questions about what youâ€™ve read or heard. The sentences may be in English or in a made-up language that you will learn during the experiment. The experiment involves a single session that will take up to an hour.</p>
<p>All participants will be asked to fill out a survey before and after the study, asking for demographic information (e.g. birth country, gender, age, education level, English proficiency) as well as judgments on the experiment at hand (e.g. how engaging was the study, how distracting was the test environment, how fairly were you compensated).</p>
<h3><b>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:</b></h3>
The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in
daily life.
<h3><b>BENEFITS:</b></h3>
There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study. This study may benefit
society if the results lead to a better understanding of what makes certain aspects of language
easier or harder to learn and understand.
<h3><b>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND RIGHT TO WITHDRAW:</b></h3>
<p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary: You choose whether to participate. If you
decide not to participate, there are no penalties, and you will not lose any benefits to which you
would otherwise be entitled.</p>
<p>If you choose to participate in the study, you can stop your participation at any time, without any
penalty or loss of benefits. If you want to withdraw from the study, please just close the window in which
you are taking the survey.</p>
<h3><b>CONFIDENTIALITY:</b></h3>
Any study records that identify you will be kept confidential to the extent possible by law. The
records from your participation may be reviewed by people responsible for making sure that
research is done properly, including members of the Johns Hopkins University Homewood
Institutional Review Board and officials from government agencies such as the National
Institutes of Health and the Office for Human Research Protections. (All of these people are
required to keep your identity confidential.) Otherwise, records that identify you will be
available only to people working on the study, unless you give permission for other people to see
the records.
<h3><b>COMPENSATION:</b></h3>
You will be compensated through Mechanical Turk in proportion to the length of the session, or with 0.5 course credits through the SONA system.
<h3><b>IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS:</b></h3>
<p>You can ask questions about this research study now or at any time during the study, by emailing our lab at jhu.psycholing@gmail.com</p>
<p>If you have questions about your rights as a research participant or feel that you have not been
treated fairly, please call the Homewood Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University
at (410) 516-6580.</p>
