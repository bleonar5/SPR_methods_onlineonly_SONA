1543951525,8def99f9a7f0ed5398dcd8d0363f4454,Form,396,0,participant_observations,NULL,feedback,Yes%2C many of the sentences did not make sense logically and seemed to be the halves of two separate sentences spliced together. Specifically%2C the subject and the action that followed did not logically correspond together. For example%2C there was a sentence that seemed to say a woman told an edgy joke but did not find it  funny. It would make more sense if the sentence said her audience did not find the joke amusing but the subject "the audience" was missing from the sentence so the reader is given the impression that the woman was the one who did not like the joke.
